# Portfolio
Hello, my name is Erica, welcome to my portfolio! Here I have gathered some of the most important things I've done in computer graphics and game development. Take a look:)

# VR asymetric collaboration maze game in Unity: "Hedged-in"
Together with a team, I created this asymetric collaboration VR game. The person in VR needs to escape from the maze, and their partner needs to guide them out by opening and closing certain walls, luring away monsters, and guiding their partner through the maze. I was in charge of creating the hedge, which I did using shell texturing, with a custom shader. For this project we used Unity URP.

# Shell texturing bunny
I have also used shell texturing for rendering fur with the Blinn-Phong shading model.

# Raytracer in Unity
I have created my own custom raytracer with bounce lighting. For this project, I used Unity and a custom shader. I also implemented a BVH to increase performance.

# Bachelor's thesis: ["Comparison between Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics and Position Based Dynamics for real-time water simulation"](https://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-335984)
My bachelor's thesis was centered around comparing two particle-based fluid simulations, in regard to performance and stability.

# Global game jam: ["Gaia Complex: Unstable Core"](https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2023/games/untitled-0)
We created a 2D platformer inspired by Celeste, where the user can jump around and use a grappling hook to evade obstacles and the ever-growing vines that trail after you. My contribition was mostly the movement of the player.
