# VR assymetric collaboration maze game in Unity
Together with a team, I was a part in creating an assymetric collaboration VR game. The person in VR needs to escape from the maze, and their partner needs to guide them out by opening anc closing certain walls, luring away monsters, and guiding them through the maze. I was in charge of creating the hedge, which I did using shell texturing, using a custom shader.

# Shell texturing bunny
Another use for shell texturing is for rendering fur, which I did for the stanford bunny. It uses a simple Blinn-Phong shading model.

# Raytracer in Unity
I have created my own custom raytracer in Unity, using a shader. I also implemented a BVH to increase performance.

# Global game jam: "Gaia Complex: Unstable Core" https://v3.globalgamejam.org/2023/games/untitled-0
We created a 2D platformer inspired by Celeste, where the user can jump around and use a grappling hook to evade obstacles and the ever-growing vines that trail after you. My contribition was mostly the movement of the player.

# 2D platformer: "u are what u eat" https://u-are-what-u-eat.webflow.io/
In this game, the player gains the ability to transform into different foods. Eating a potato lets the player roll over enemies, but eating noodles lets the player grapple and slap enemies.

# Bachelor's thesis: Comparison between Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics and Position Based Dynamics for real-time water simulation
My bachelor's thesis was centered around comparing two particle-based fluid simualations, in regard to performance and stability.
